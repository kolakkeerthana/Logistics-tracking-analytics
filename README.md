## üìå Introduction
This project explores a dataset sourced from Kaggle containing detailed records of logistics tracking and transportation events. The dataset was originally in `.xlsx` format and focuses on shipment timelines, supplier performance, vehicle utilization, and delivery efficiency.

Our objective is to clean, validate, and analyze the dataset to derive actionable insights on delivery performance, vehicle optimization, and monthly transportation trends. These insights can help organizations enhance operational efficiency and supplier management.

## üßπ Data Cleaning & Preparation

1. **File Extraction**
   - The `.zip` dataset was extracted using Python's `zipfile` module.

2. **Initial Data Validation**
   - Reviewed dataset for missing values, duplicates, and unusual trends.
   - Focused on key columns: booking dates, ETA (Planned and Actual), origin, destination, supplier ID, and vehicle information.

3. **Handling Null Values**
   - Dropped rows where both `ontime` and `delay` columns were missing, ensuring every record had a delivery status.

4. **Data Type Conversion**
   - Converted date-related columns (`Planned_ETA`, `actual_eta`, `BookingID_Date`) to datetime format for accurate analysis.
   
5. **Delay Duration Calculation**
   - Created a new feature `delay_duration` (in hours) by calculating the difference between actual and planned arrival times.
   - Any negative delays were treated as zero (early deliveries).

6. **Outlier Removal**
   - Used the IQR (Interquartile Range) method to filter out extreme outliers from delay durations for clearer trend visualization.


## üîç Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

1. **Delivery Performance Breakdown**
   - Created a pie chart visualizing the percentage of on-time vs delayed deliveries.

the image displays ontime vs delivery rate in the dataset.

2. **Top Delayed Routes**
   - Identified origin-destination pairs with the highest number of delayed trips and calculated their average delay duration.

Average Delay Duration (hours): 237.80
Maximum delay(hours):7394.95

---
3. **Vehicle Performance**
   - Found underutilized and overutilized vehicles based on trip counts.
   - Highlighted vehicles that were either overworked or seldom used.

4. **Supplier Performance**
   - Computed average transportation distance per supplier, enabling supplier efficiency comparison.

5. **Monthly Trip Trends**
   - Analyzed the number of trips each month across two years.
   - Created pivot tables to separate trends for each year and plotted comparative line graphs.

The chart represents number of trips permonth.

6. **Delay Trends Over Time**
   - Tracked monthly average delivery delay durations, both with and without outlier influence, using line and bar charts.

The image shows the average delay duration for every month but the lines are dicontinuous because of outlliers making t difficult to understand the data.

7. **Correlation Analysis**
   - Explored relationships between transportation distance and delivery timelines.

Correlation Matrix:
                               TRANSPORTATION_DISTANCE_IN_KM  actual_eta  \
TRANSPORTATION_DISTANCE_IN_KM                       1.000000    0.125025   
actual_eta                                          0.125025    1.000000   
Planned_ETA                                         0.129862    0.999515
